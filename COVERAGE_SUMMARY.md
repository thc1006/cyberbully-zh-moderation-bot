## 📈 Coverage Analysis Deep Dive

### **High-Performance Modules** ✅
- **Safety Rules** (81.69%): PII handling, crisis response, human review workflows
- **Configuration** (73.98%): Settings validation, environment handling
- **Label Mapping** (57.51%): Dataset conversion, unified schema

### **Critical Modules Needing Attention** ⚠️
